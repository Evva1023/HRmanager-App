# HRmanager-App

### This was built in a week time, using Express and React.

It is a simple desktop app helping to manage staff in a company. Also has a task list for the user.
Staff data is stored in a database, tasks are saved in a file.

As a React beginner I made the login very simple. Authorization and authentication to be done soon.

Login name: test

Password: test

Currently making changes in files for the deployment here:  https://hrm-qe99.onrender.com/
