# HRmanager-App

This was built in a week time, using Express and React.

It is a simple desktop app helping to manage staff in a company. Also has a task list for the user although it should be hidden until the user logs in.
Staff data is stored in a database, tasks are saved in a file.

As a React beginner I made the login very simple, it still needs to be fixed to prevent logging users out when they switch to the home page.
